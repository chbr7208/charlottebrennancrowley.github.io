            <h2> hi </h2>
            <h3> she/her/hers </h3>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am a senior majoring in business administration with a dual area of emphasis in accounting and management. I am also double minoring in creative technology design and Spanish. 
                The creative technology design minor provides a broad multidisciplinary perspective that integrates technological skills with a critical, theoretical and historical understanding of technology, media and design. I live in Boulder, Colorado and ready to move around once I graduate.
                I would love to travel in my twenties. After graduation I am looking for a job that allows me to work remotely or includes a lot of travel.</p> 
            <p> I am just playing around with my style sheet and the rules/classes I've added. Once I add more to my HTML page there will be more. I also need help with certain styling things.</p>

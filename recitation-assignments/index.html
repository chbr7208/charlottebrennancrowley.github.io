            <h2><u>(she/her/hers)</u></h2>
            <p>I am eager to learn more about coding as well as being able to create a super <strong>cool</strong> website. 
            I am a <em>senior</em> (it's my fifth year). I am a business accounting and management major with two minors in CTD and Spanish. I switched out of environmental engineering as a junior so it pushed me back a little.
        My parents have three dogs and they are my favorite things on the planet.</p>

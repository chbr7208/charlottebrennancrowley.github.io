                <h3>January 2022</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I arrived in Barcelona the first week of January. My apartment was near the Arc de Triomf close to the Born District. In the first week we learned about the history of the Gothic Quarter and even celebrated the 3 Kings parade.</p></li>
                <li><p>The first time I traveled in Spain was to Valencia. My roommates and I took the train. We went to the museum of modern sciences, we had paella on the beach, and we walked the entirety of center city.</p></li>
                <li><p>In class we were learning a lot about early art history in Spain. We toured the Gothic Quarter where we looked at the architecture of the Cathedral. We learned about how the Romans split the city in half and where they buried the dead. Our Spanish classes taught us how to use certain slang and say things a specific way in Spanish that made us sound like we were from Spain. </p></li>
                <li><p>My last trip in January was to Madrid. I went with 10 people. We went to the palace, took a tour of the city, went to the main plaza, and went to a discoteca. We stayed in a nicer hostel, got to try the famous churros con chocolate and a calamari sandwich.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>February 2022</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The first weekend in February my friend came to visit. Together we stayed at an apartment in the born district which allowed us to get to know it. We went to the beach, tried famous sandwiches from Bo De B, and went to a few different bars. Our favorite part was going to the FC Barcelona game.</p></li>
                <li><p>The second weekend we went cava tasting at Codorniu. We learned about how the cava process is different than the champagne process. We also took a tour of La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell.</p></li>
                <li><p>In class, we were learning about the history of the Born District and how it came to be. It focused on mercantalism.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>March 2022</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>My dad and step-mom came and visited me. While they were here we indulged in cafe con leche and lots of pastries. We did a city bus tour and went to the Gaudi house, Casa Mila.</p></li>
                <li><p>My best friend Tara came to visit and we went to the discoteca, Casa Batllo, and Tibidabo. Tibidabo is the amusement park in Barcelona that also has churches with it.</p></li>
                <li><p>My roommates and I got to celebrate Carnaval, which is their version of Marti Gras. We took a bus to Sitges and watched an entire parade full of people in extravagant costumes dancing their way through.</p></li>
                <li><p>My first trip out of the country took place in March. I went with friends from Boulder to Berlin. We stayed in a super sketchy hotel, went to a beer garden, a flea market, and tried pom friets with curried ketchup.</p></li>
                <li><p>I also took a trip to Dublin. My friend and I went to Howth to see the Howth cliffs, we went to Temple bar, and even saw a professional rugby game. We stayed with a girl who was in college and renting out a room to airbnb. This worked out well because she showed us around.</p></li>
                <li><p>In class we were focusing on contemporary art. We went to the national art museum of Catalunya which is practically a huge castle.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>April 2022</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>For the first weekend in April, my roommate and I went to Italy. We went to both Rome and Florence where we hit all of the sight seeing. When we were in Florence we took a wine tour in Tuscany.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once classes ended, my mom's side of the family came to visit. We took a paella cooking class, toured all of the churches, and even went to a few different discotecas.</p></li>
                <li><p>When we left Barcelona, we took our last trip to Lisbon. Here we took a food and drink tour, went to the LX factory market, and took a day trip to Sintra.</p></li>

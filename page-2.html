                <p>I am a 22 year old originally from Northern California, right around Napa. This is my fifth year in Boulder and I am planning on moving after graduation. Like I mentioned, I would love to travel in my twenties. After graduation I am looking for a job that allows me to work remotely or includes a lot of travel. 
                I am looking for jobs that incorporate all of my skills. The creative technology design minor provides a broad multidisciplinary perspective that integrates technological skills with a critical, theoretical and historical understanding of technology, media and design. 
                My accounting background allows me to successfully understand the ins and outs of most accounting processes. My fluency in Spanish opens up opportunities in many different Spanish speaking countries. </p>
